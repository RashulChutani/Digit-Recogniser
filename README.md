# Digit-Recogniser
Used ML Algorithms to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and predict what that digit is.

A list of list of Pixel Intensities was used to train a K Nearest Neighbour classifier using Sci-Kit Learn Library in Python.
The trained algorithm has an accuracy of 92.7% when run on a test set.

The project is a part of Kaggle Digit Recogniser competition.

In order to make any changes to the code and increase the accuracy clone/download the repository and use Python Editors for any editing.
